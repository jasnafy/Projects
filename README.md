# My Projects  
You'll be finding my projects on this repository. I'll have a breakdown of each one of them below.

## Project 1 - Power BI, Survey Occupation
In this project I have used a real survey that has been taken in August 2022. 630 people have filled in this survey about their occupation, happiness, salary, etc.  
With Power Query, I have cleaned the data, adjusted the data, and used Power BI to visualize this survey.

## Project 2 - COVID-19 Data Analysis with SQL  
I utilized real-world data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) for this project. Specifically, I worked with COVID-19 data to demonstrate my ability to analyze and manipulate data using SQL.
This project showcases my proficiency with various SQL queries and techniques, highlighting my skills in data management and analysis.

## Project 3 - Webscraping Data with Jupyter & Python
In this project I'll be webscraping data using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and BeautifulSoup and smtplib libraries.  
I chose to webscrape Bol.com. The scraper extracts product title, price, and current date. It features automated email notifications, sending real-time alerts about price changes directly to the users' inbox. It also saves the dataset to a .csv file for potential use in the future.

## Project 4 - Data Cleaning, Pivot Tables, Dashboard  
In this project, I used Excel to analyze and clean data, as well as to create insightful Pivot Tables and Charts. The dataset, titled "Bike Sales", represents a company's sales data and aims to uncover customer buying trends. The analysis focused on factors such as age, gender, commute distance, car ownership, and income, providing valuable insights into the profile of bike buyers.

## Project 5 - Coffee Sales Dashboard
I created an interactive dashboard in Excel to display coffee sales data. First, I made sure the data was clean and ready to use by removing duplicates, adding new information from existing data, and rewording some of it to make it easier to understand for the stakeholders. I also used some functions like XLOOKUP to fill in missing data. Once everything was organized and complete, I set up a pivot table and used it to build the interactive dashboard.
