# My Projects  
You'll be finding my projects on this repository. I'll have a breakdown of each one of them below.

## Project 1 - Power BI, Survey Occupation
In this project I have used a real survey that has been taken in August 2022. 630 people have filled in this survey about their occupation, happiness, salary, etc.  
With Power Query, I have cleaned the data, adjusted the data, and used Power BI to visualize this survey.
